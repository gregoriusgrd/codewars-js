Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

Input = ["Peter", "Stephen", "Joe"]
Output = []
Input strings will only contain letters.
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

function friend(friends){
    const result = friends.join(',').replace(/ /g, "").match(/\b[a-z]{4}\b/gi)
    return result ? result : []
}

console.log(friend(["Ryan", "Jimmy", "123", "4", "Cool Man"]))
